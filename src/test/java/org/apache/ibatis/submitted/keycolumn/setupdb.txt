The tests in this package are dependent on a local install
of PostgreSQL.  This file contains instructions for setting up
PostgreSQL so that the tests will run successfully.  To run the tests,
follow the database setup instructions in this file, then remove the
@Ignore annotation on the test class and run the tests with Maven
or a local JUnit test runner.

DO NOT commit the test class without the @Ignore annotation or it will
break the MyBatis build on machines that don't have PostgreSQL setup.

1. Download and install PostgreSQL.  Set the password for the
   "postgres" userid to "root".  If you choose a different password,
   you will need to alter the MapperConfig.xml file accordingly.
2. Create a database called "mbtest"
3. Create a schema in "mbtest" database called "mbtest"
4. Create the following table:

   CREATE TABLE mbtest.test_identity
   (
     first_name character varying(30),
     last_name character varying(30),
     name_id serial NOT NULL,
     CONSTRAINT test_identity_pkey PRIMARY KEY (name_id)
   )
   WITH (
     OIDS=FALSE
   );
   ALTER TABLE mbtest.test_identity OWNER TO postgres;
