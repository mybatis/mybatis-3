The refcursor tests in this package are dependent on a local install
of PostgreSQL.  This file contains instructions for setting up
PostgreSQL so that the tests will run successfully.  To run the tests,
follow the database setup instructions in this file, then remove the
@Ignore annotation on the test class and run the tests with Maven
or a local JUnit test runner.

DO NOT commit the test class without the @Ignore annotation or it will
break the MyBatis build on machines that don't have PostgreSQL setup.

1. Download and install PostgreSQL.  Set the password for the
   "postgres" userid to "root".  If you choose a different password,
   you will need to alter the MapperConfig.xml file accordingly.
   [1] See steps for ubuntu
2. Create a database called "mbtest"
3. Create a schema in "mbtest" database called "mbtest"
4. Create the following two tables:

   CREATE TABLE mbtest.order_detail
   (
     order_id integer NOT NULL,
     line_number integer NOT NULL,
     quantity integer NOT NULL,
     item_description character varying(50) NOT NULL,
     CONSTRAINT order_detail_pkey PRIMARY KEY (order_id, line_number)
   )
   WITH (
     OIDS=FALSE
   );
   ALTER TABLE mbtest.order_detail OWNER TO postgres;

   CREATE TABLE mbtest.order_header
   (
     order_id integer NOT NULL,
     cust_name character varying(50) NOT NULL,
     CONSTRAINT order_header_pkey PRIMARY KEY (order_id)
   )
   WITH (
     OIDS=FALSE
   );
   ALTER TABLE mbtest.order_header OWNER TO postgres;

5. Insert rows into the tables as follows:

   INSERT INTO mbtest.order_header(order_id, cust_name)
      VALUES (1, 'Fred');
   INSERT INTO mbtest.order_header(order_id, cust_name)
      VALUES (2, 'Barney');

   INSERT INTO mbtest.order_detail(order_id, line_number, quantity, item_description)
      VALUES (1, 1, 1, 'Pen');
   INSERT INTO mbtest.order_detail(order_id, line_number, quantity, item_description)
      VALUES (1, 2, 3, 'Pencil');
   INSERT INTO mbtest.order_detail(order_id, line_number, quantity, item_description)
      VALUES (1, 3, 2, 'Notepad');
   INSERT INTO mbtest.order_detail(order_id, line_number, quantity, item_description)
      VALUES (2, 1, 1, 'Compass');
   INSERT INTO mbtest.order_detail(order_id, line_number, quantity, item_description)
      VALUES (2, 2, 1, 'Protractor');
   INSERT INTO mbtest.order_detail(order_id, line_number, quantity, item_description)
      VALUES (2, 3, 2, 'Pencil');

6. Create the following function:

   CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION mbtest.get_order(order_number integer)
     RETURNS refcursor AS
   $BODY$
   DECLARE
     mycurs refcursor;
   BEGIN
     open mycurs for select a.*, b.*
     from mbtest.order_header a join mbtest.order_detail b
       on a.order_id = b.order_id
     where a.order_id = ORDER_NUMBER;
     return mycurs;
   END;
   $BODY$
     LANGUAGE plpgsql VOLATILE
     COST 100;
   ALTER FUNCTION mbtest.get_order(integer) OWNER TO postgres;

[1] Installation in Ubuntu
   sudo apt-get install postgresql
   sudo su - postgres
   createdb mbtest
   psql mbtest
   CREATE SCHEMA mbtest;
   ALTER USER postgres WITH PASSWORD 'root';
