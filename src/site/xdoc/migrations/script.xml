    <section name="The 'script' command">
      <p>While we developers wish we had unlimited access to every environment, the unfortunate truth is that we don’t.
      Often it’s the very production environment that we’re targeting that we don’t have access to. Someone else, a DBA
      or Change Management team will need to apply any changes. However, we don’t want this to be an excuse to not use a
      good, automated change management tool.</p>

      <p>MyBatis Migrations provides the <b>script</b> command to generate a script that can migrate a schema from one
      version to another. As mentioned above, this will likely always be in an upward direction, but the script command
      does also support generating undo scripts (just in case you’re so unfortunate that you don’t even have access to
      central development databases!).</p>

      <p>The script command is quite simple. It takes two version numbers as parameters. Think of it as generating a
      script to apply all of the identified versions (inclusive) in the order specified.
      For example, given the following:</p>

      <source>/home/cbegin/testdb$ migrate status

20090804225207 2009-08-04 22:51:17 create author table
20090804225328 2009-08-05 24:55:23 create blog table
20090804225333 2009-08-04 22:51:17 create post table</source>

      <p>If we need to generate a “do” script to apply the two highlighted versions above, we’d run the following command:</p>

      <source>/home/cbegin/testdb$ migrate script 20090804225328 20090804225333 > do.sql</source>

      <p>The script command outputs to stdout, so you can let it print to the console, or pipe it to a file or command.</p>

      <p>To generate the corresponding “undo” script, simply specify the version numbers in the opposite order:</p>

      <source>/home/cbegin/testdb$ migrate script 20090804225333 20090804225328 > undo.sql</source>
