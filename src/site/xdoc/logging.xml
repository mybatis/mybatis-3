      <p></p>
      <p>MyBatis provides logging information through the use of an
        internal
        log factory. The internal log factory will delegate logging
        information to one of the following log implementations:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          SLF4J
        </li>
        <li>
          Apache Commons Logging
        </li>
        <li>
          Log4J
        </li>
        <li>
          JDK logging
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The logging solution chosen is based on runtime introspection by
        the internal MyBatis log factory. The MyBatis log factory will use
        the first logging implementation it finds (implementations are
        searched in the above order). If MyBatis finds none of the above
        implementations, then logging will be disabled.
      </p>
      <p>Many environments ship Commons Logging as a part of the application server
        classpath (good examples include Tomcat and WebSphere). It is
        important to know that in such environments, MyBatis will use Commons Logging as
        the logging implementation. In an environment like WebSphere this
        will mean that your Log4J configuration will be ignored because
        WebSphere supplies its own proprietary implementation of Commons Logging. This
        can be very frustrating because it will appear that MyBatis is
        ignoring your Log4J configuration (in fact, MyBatis is ignoring your
        Log4J configuration because MyBatis will use Commons Logging in such
        environments). If your application is running in an
        environment
        where Commons Logging is included in the classpath but you would
        rather use one
        of the other logging implementations you can select a
        different
        logging implementation by calling one of the following
        methods:
      </p>
      <source><![CDATA[org.apache.ibatis.logging.LogFactory.useSlf4jLogging();
org.apache.ibatis.logging.LogFactory.useLog4JLogging();
org.apache.ibatis.logging.LogFactory.useJdkLogging();
org.apache.ibatis.logging.LogFactory.useCommonsLogging();
org.apache.ibatis.logging.LogFactory.useStdOutLogging();]]></source>
      <p>If you choose to call one of these methods, you should do so
        before
        calling any other MyBatis method. Also, these methods
        will only
        switch to the requested log implementation if that
        implementation is
        available on the runtime classpath. For example, if
        you try to
        select
        Log4J logging and Log4J is not available at runtime,
        then MyBatis
        will ignore the request to use Log4J and will use it's
        normal
        algorithm for discovering logging implementations.
      </p>
      <p>The specifics of Apache Commons Logging, Apache Log4J and the JDK
        Logging
        API are beyond the scope of this document. However the
        example
        configuration below should get you started. If you would like
        to
        know
        more about these frameworks, you can get more information from
        the
        following locations:

      <subsection name="Logging Configuration">
        <p>MyBatis logs most of its activity using log classes that are not
          in the MyBatis packages. To see MyBatis logging statements, you
          should enable logging on classes in the <code>java.sql</code> package &#x2013;
          specifically the following classes:
        </p>
        <p><code>java.sql.Connection</code>, <code>java.sql.PreparedStatement</code> and
        <code>java.sql.Resultsetjava.sql.Statement</code></p>
        <p>Again, how you do this is dependent on the logging implementation
          in use. We'll show how to do it with Log4J. Configuring the
          logging services is simply a matter of including one or more extra
          configuration files (e.g. log4j.properties) and sometimes a new JAR
          file (e.g. log4j.jar). The following example configuration will
          configure full logging services using Log4J as a provider. There
          are
          2 steps.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <h4>
          Step 1: Add the Log4J JAR file
        </h4>
        <p>Because we are using Log4J, we will need to ensure its
          JAR file is available to our application. To use Log4J, you need to
          add the JAR file to your application classpath. You can download
          Log4J from the URL above.
        </p>
        <p>For web or enterprise applications you can add the <code>log4j.jar</code> to
          your <code>WEB-INF/lib</code> directory, or for a standalone application you can
          simply add it to the JVM <code>-classpath</code> startup parameter.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <h4>
          Step 2: Configure Log4J
        </h4>
        <p>Configuring Log4J is simple - you create a file called
          <code>log4j.properties</code> and it looks like the following:
        </p>
        <source><![CDATA[# Global logging configuration
log4j.rootLogger=ERROR, stdout
# MyBatis logging configuration...
#log4j.logger.org.apache.ibatis=DEBUG
#log4j.logger.java.sql.Connection=DEBUG
#log4j.logger.java.sql.Statement=DEBUG
#log4j.logger.java.sql.PreparedStatement=DEBUG
#log4j.logger.java.sql.ResultSet=DEBUG
# Console output...
log4j.appender.stdout=org.apache.log4j.ConsoleAppender
log4j.appender.stdout.layout=org.apache.log4j.PatternLayout
log4j.appender.stdout.layout.ConversionPattern=%5p [%t] - %m%n]]></source>
        <p>The above file is the minimal configuration that will cause
          logging to only report on errors. Line 2 of the file is what is
          shown to be configuring Log4J to only report errors to the stdout
          appender. An appender is a component that collects output (e.g.
          console, file, database etc.). To maximize the level of reporting,
          we could change line 2 as follows:
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <source>log4j.rootLogger=DEBUG, stdout</source>
        <p></p>
        <p>By changing line 2 as above, Log4J will now report on all logged
          events to the <code>stdout</code> appender (console). If you
          want
          to tune the logging at a finer level, you can configure each class
          that logs to the system using the &#x2018;SqlMap logging
          configuration&#x2019; section of the file above (commented out in
          lines 4 through 8 above). So if we wanted to log <code>PreparedStatement</code>
          activity (SQL statements) to the console at the <code>DEBUG</code> level, we
          would simply change line 7 to the following (notice it&#x2019;s not
          #commented out anymore):
        </p>

        <source>log4j.logger.java.sql.PreparedStatement=DEBUG</source>

        <p>The remaining configuration in the <code>log4j.properties</code> file is used
          to configure the appenders, which is beyond the scope of this
          document. However, you can find more information at the Log4J
          website (URL above). Or, you could simply experiment with it to see
          what effects the different configuration options have.
